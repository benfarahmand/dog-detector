# dog-detector
A dog has pooped in my front yard. We need to find out who did the deed.


Set up a webcam, analyze the video stream with pytorch and opencv with the Yolov5 model, then save a picture of the culprit.

Using a CUDA graphics card for the image analysis. You could possibly get away with using a CPU, but it'll slow and the dog may get away before you snap a picture.

Feel free to use this code.
